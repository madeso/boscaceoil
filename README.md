![logo](data/logo.png "Bosca Ceoil")

A simple music making program. Originally written by Terry Cavanagh. Available under the FreeBSD licence. Feel free to fork Bosca Ceoil and do your own thing with it!

This fork is a attempt to
1. Port it to c++ so it can be run on more systems (without adobe air)
2. Replace the custom ui with a dear imgui based ui
3. Replace the embdded synth with a custom synth (or also port SiON) with more features (sf2 support)
4. Extend the piano roll with a simpler interface for drums and a more complex tracker like alternative
